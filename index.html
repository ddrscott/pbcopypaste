            ## OS X High School

            `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` were the new kids at OSX High School. All the
            students picked on them because they could never do anything on
            their own. Teachers thought they were weird for always playing with
            pipes.

          <h2>Blank Pages</h2>
          <p>
            On the first day after winter break, the school website was
            rendering blank pages. No one could see their calendars or agendas
            and the IT guy was stuck in Bermuda.

          <h2>Ada</h2>
          <p>
            Ada, the STEM lab assistant, thought she'd better take a look. She
            started by poking around in the browser's devtools. The responses
            were all 200s, but there were some console errors.

            "Eureka!", Ada exclaimed. "The JSON response must have changed!"

            ## Too Much Text 

            She quickly went to the response tab and tried to preview the data,
            but there was too much for her browser to handle. She copied the
            response using CMD-a and CMD-c, and tried to paste it into her
            editor. Alas, the editor kept freezing trying to format the huge
            amount of text!

            ## pbpaste
`pbpaste` wandered by noticing the frustration in Ada's slouch.

She came right up to Ada and said, "Um, I can put that JSON in a file for you. Would you mind if I took a shot at it?"

"Go ahead", scoffed Ada in disbelief, "Let's see what you can do."

            <code>pbpaste</code> responded, "It's because I have direct access
            to the pasteboard. I can read it to any file or command. Watch this!
            I can pipe my output to <code>jq</code> to pretty format the JSON. All without a bloated IDE slowing things down."

            `pbcopy` sat back as if she'd just finished a big meal. She pushed up her glasses and added, "When I work together with `pbpaste`, you won't need to waste brain cells thinking of clever temporary file names!"

            ## Rails Console

Ada wanted to bring them down a notch. She stated, "This is great when I'm in shell, but I usually have all my data in Rails objects from within the console. Then what?"

Leaning forward, `pbcopy` responded, "That's even better! When you're in IRB, try piping the data straight to me."

          <p> Together, they were so excited and said at the same time, "We have
            this snippet in our <code>~/.pryrc</code> which makes working with us even easier!"

            ## Typo
In the midst of all the terminal output and pretty formatted JSON, `pbpaste` noticed an odd misspelling.

```json
{
  posts: ["..."]
  aggendas: ["..."]
}
```

            ## Solved
"This is what must be causing the undefined error! Isn't ajjenda spelled with 'j's?" `pbpaste` asked.

`pbcopy` jumped in quickly, "Correction, it only has _one_ 'j'!"

Ada, finally smiling, replied "You two were made for each other!"
